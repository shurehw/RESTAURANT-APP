## OpsOS: Investor Positioning

### What This Is (and Isn't)

OpsOS is not SaaS analytics, not workflow tooling, and not an AI assistant.

OpsOS is **operational governance infrastructure**.

It enforces how restaurants respond to variance — every night, across labor, comps, refunds, and execution — with permanent accountability and auditability.

### Why AI Does Not Kill This

AI commoditizes:

* dashboards
* reporting
* summarization
* generic automation

AI does not commoditize:

* authority
* enforcement
* incentives
* governance
* behavior change

OpsOS uses AI **subordinately**:

* to review explanations
* to detect patterns
* to suggest corrective actions

AI never closes exceptions, overrides enforcement, or rewrites history.

OpsOS enforces. AI assists.

### Why This Is Defensible

OpsOS creates lock-in by:

* owning the nightly operating record
* enforcing irreversible workflows
* embedding accountability into habit
* becoming the system used to resolve disputes

Once OpsOS is embedded, removing it removes control.

---

### Why This Is Not "Build Your Own"

Allowing customers to author workflows destroys enforcement.

OpsOS provides:

* fixed operating standards
* tunable sensitivity
* bounded configuration

Customers calibrate. They do not redesign.

This preserves discipline while allowing adoption across different operators.

### Why Outcome-Based Pricing Works Here

OpsOS directly enforces:

* labor variance reduction
* comp and refund control
* elimination of repeat mistakes

Because OpsOS controls:

* baselines
* exception logs
* resolution timelines
* audit trails

…savings attribution is provable, auditable, and finance-safe.

This enables hybrid pricing:

* base platform fee
* plus participation in verified savings

---

### Market Reality

This product is for serious operators:

* multi-unit
* high-volume
* high-variance
* ops-driven leadership

It is intentionally not designed for SMB flexibility.

This focus enables scale through discipline, not breadth.

---

### The Core Bet

Restaurants do not fail from lack of insight.
They fail from lack of enforced follow-through.

OpsOS exists to close that gap.

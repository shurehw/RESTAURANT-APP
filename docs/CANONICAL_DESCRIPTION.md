## Canonical OpsOS Description

OpsOS is a restaurant operations enforcement system that turns nightly performance variance into required explanation, corrective action, and auditable follow-through.

It sits above existing POS, labor, and finance tools, detects exceptions against fixed operating standards, requires structured attestations from accountable owners, generates tasks to resolve root causes, and maintains an immutable audit trail over time.

OpsOS does not provide insights and hope behavior changes — it enforces discipline continuously, with limited calibration but no escape.
